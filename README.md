# Food Finder

A dynamic web application for food lovers to find and review restaurants.

I wanted to build this project to put my limits to the test. Prior to starting the project, I have spent approximately 4 months learning (but not limited to) HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES5/ES6), Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and React. This was my first full stack web application where I incororated all of my past knowledge and built something awesome! I used Amazon S3 to file upload cloud storage and depoloyed using Heroku.
